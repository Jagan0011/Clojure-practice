;A closure is a function that has access to some named value/variable outside its own scope, so from a higher scope surrounding the function when it was created.
(ns hello1.core
  (:gen-class))
  
 (defn -main
  "I don't do a whole lot ... yet."
  [& args]
  (println "Hello, Team this is new!!")
  ;closure
  (defn inner [from-outer]
    (fn [] 
      (println from-outer))
    )
   (def outer1 (inner "this is from outer"))
   (println outer1)
   (println (outer1))
   

 )
